# JackBot

All components of our game were created from scratch in **three** days for the MagaraJam2023 event. We are continuing to develop the game.

#### Storyline
Jack has been detained by the Bot. Even his mobility now is at the mercy of the Bot. The Bot's identity is a mistery.
At every obstacle, the unmerciful Bot gives him limited powers. Will Jack survive as he struggles to complete the levels?

#### Gameplay
At the beginning of each level, the Bot gives some random moves and abilities from its jackpot that help Jack to defeat enemies. Jack tries to complete the level and move on to the next one with those.

###### Game mechanics:
**GrappleHook:** Used with the mouse. Helps to hold on to a wall and jump.

**Move:** Simple movement mechanic. Used with WASD and arrows keys - the Bot has taken away even this!

**Dash:** Lets Jack dash forward with the **J** key.

###### Abilities:
**Bubble:** Used with the **E** key. Levitates the enemies.

**Invisibility:** Used with the **C** key. Prevents the enemies from damaging Jack.

**Clone:** Used with the **K** key. A clone of Jack appears and moves forward. It can destroy the enemies.

*Many more mechanics are to be developed and added to the game!*
